	<h3>welcome to my personal website<br>
		<i><font size="2">Posted in 05/03/21 - 19:02 by Euroblitz</font></h3></i>

	<p>this is (kinda) my personal website, where i host my projects and some stuff about me. i will keep these pages as minimal and resource-friendly as possible, without javascript and anything else that web doesn't needs to work. here you can find out who i am or what i do, as well some config files for linux/windows desktop ricing, scripts, and things I like to code.<br>

	<h3>VIRTUAL PLEASURE - 病理学的思考 cd release! <br>
		<i><font size="2">Posted in 12/28/21 - 16:04 by Euroblitz</font></h3></i>

	<p>i've started into vaporwave world since i was 12-14yo, i really fell in love with it. now i started to sample some tunes here and there, mostly barber beats or something that i like to call 'post-vapor-trash-like-wave-something'. odd, huh? yeah, for now they are simply and neatly arranged samples, but that doesn't takes off the credit from me.<p>

my band/artistc name is called <a href="https://virtualpleasure.bandcamp.com/">VIRTUAL PLEASURE</a> on bandcamp, and it has a page too, you can check it out. my last two works was two ~30min long eps with 4 or 5 songs on each, just to name a few of them. they're usually composed of slow jazz tunes that arrange neatly looped to create amazing barber beats, just like some vaporwave artists i follow and love do them (macroblank, haircuts for men, and so on).<p>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Euroblitz/euroblitz.github.io/main/img/cover_making.jpg"></img><font size="1">a quick photo of me taping some details on the album cover, that gonna be released soon (i hope)</font><p>you can check the album on bandcamp <a href="https://virtualpleasure.bandcamp.com/album/--3">in this link</a>. i did choose these mini 8cm cds/single because they're neat for a small-lenght album or few songs. i often did see them shipping with cheap usb controllers or webcam for providing drivers, as they only can store less than 200mb in data and 21-23 minutes of raw audio for cd players. i've finished the casing design and almost finishing the cd face sticker, the cds i bought are yellow with name labels to write on them, a printable sticker should do the trick.<p>i'm going to start selling them soon on bandcamp, starting 10 USD base price for the clear plastic shells, as each of the copies are personalised, and 5 USD for the simple paper/carton sleeve covers. both of them comes with the same number of tracks, but i had to shorten a track or two to make them fit on these cds, not a big deal, just put repeat on. and the 10 USD version comes with a custom... thing on the plastic shell, hehe. just stay tuned on my <a href="https://virtualpleasure.bandcamp.com/">bandcamp</a> and/or <a href="https://twitter.com/virtuapleasure/">twitter</a> to check how's going.
