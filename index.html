				<p>Hello! This is my personal webpage where I host my (mostly dead) projects and other cool stuff about me. I will keep these pages as minimal and resource-friendly as possible, without anything else that web doesn't needs to work. Here you can find out who I am or what I do as well, and some config files for Linux/Windows ricing, scripts, and other things I like to code or do. I also make some music under the <a href="https://virtualpleasure.bandcamp.com/music">VIRTUAL PLEASURE</a> artistic name and I'm trying to upload them here from time to time.
					
				<p>As I don't use (<a href="/contact.html">almost</a>) any social network pages to share content I tought it was a good idea to create this page and share everything I would like if I had one, with no restrictions or censorship. Even if I don't update it too often, I like how it looks. If you want to know more stuff about me and my character check under <a href="/bio.html">bio</a> and <a href="fursona">fursona</a>, I have a pretty cool art gallery of my sona there if you want to sneak into it. And I usually make some blog posts and a few Linux tutorials on how to fix/run some weird stuff if you're into that kind of stuff.
