            <p>Hello! This is my personal webpage where I host my (mostly dead) projects and other cool stuff about me. I will keep these pages as minimal and resource-friendly as possible, without anything else that web doesn't needs to work. Here you can find out who I am or what I do as well, and some config files for Linux/Windows ricing, scripts, and other things I like to code or do. I also make some music under the <a href="https://virtualpleasure.bandcamp.com/music">VIRTUAL PLEASURE</a> artistic name and I'm trying to upload them here from time to time.
            
            <p>As I don't use <a href="/contact.html">almost</a> any social network pages to share content I tought it was a good idea to create this page and share everything I would like if I had one, with no restrictions or censorship. Even if I don't update it too often, I like how it looks. If you want to know more stuff about me and my character check under <a href="/bio.html">bio</a> and <a href="fursona">fursona</a>, I have a pretty cool art gallery of my sona there if you want to sneak into it. And I usually make some blog posts and a few Linux tutorials on how to fix/run some weird stuff if you're into that kind of stuff.

                  <b>Just a quickie about the styling: literally all CSS code on these pages are embedded on the HTML code from the pages itself. I just find that more practical and easier to make some adjustments, so I don't have a lot of separate CSS files to a big number of pages. And there's nothing special about the CSS, just plain and simple formatting!</b>

            <p>Maybe you found about me on a furry con somewhere by scanning the QR code on the back of my badge. Maybe you found me dead somewhere wearing my badge and scanned the QR code on the back. Or even found my website floating around the web somewhere for some reason. If that's so, welcome and feel free to sneak around. The badge on the right was made by my friend <a href="https://x.com/kinguir">@kinguir</a> for BFF 2023
            
            <p>I like fursuits, drinks, hugs, meeting new people and hanging around! If you see me around Brazil FurFest or FurSMeet, come say hi (because there's a good chance I probably won't, thanks autism and being extremely shy sometimes). I may need a while (or two) to get used to talking to new people, but when I do I'll certainly enjoy the conversation and being around! I might even bring my Nintendo Wii to the apartment!
            
            <p>Speaking of my travels to furry cons around Brazil, I have a little photo album on this website (WIP), and you may be on some photos or not, feel free to <a href="https://euroblitz.github.io/contact.html">contact</a> me if you want any of these photos censored or maybe deleted!
