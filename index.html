         <h3>Welcome to the bear's cave</h3>
         <img src="https://euroblitz.github.io/img/avatar.jpg" width="190" class="avatar"></img>
         <p>Hello! This is my personal webpage where I host my (mostly dead) <a href="https://euroblitz.github.io/projects.html">projects</a> and other cool stuff about me. I will keep these pages as minimal and resource-friendly as possible, without anything else that web doesn't needs to work. Here you can find out who I am or what I do as well, and some config files for Linux/Windows ricing, scripts, and other things I like to code or do. I used to make some music under the <a href="https://virtualpleasure.bandcamp.com/">VIRTUAL PLEASURE</a> artistic name and I'm trying to upload them here from time to time, but I don't produce anything anymore, for now. The project had to be terminated indefinitely because of some issues wtih PayPal regards payments in my country.
         <p>As I don't use <a href="/contact.html">almost</a> any social network pages to share content I tought it was a good idea to create this page and share everything I would like if I had one, with no restrictions or censorship. Even if I don't update it too often, I like how it looks. If you want to know more stuff about me and my character check under bio and fursona, I have a pretty cool art gallery of my sona <a href="/fursona.html">right here</a> if you want to sneak into it. And I usually make some blog posts and a few Linux tutorials on how to fix/run some weird stuff if you're into that kind of stuff.
