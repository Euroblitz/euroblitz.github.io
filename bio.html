         <h3>About me</h3>
<p>Well, what can I say? I'm a Linux enthustiast of course. I like to shove down every part of my PC and operating system since I was 7-8 (my 'hobby' when I was at that age was looking through windows/system32 folders and clicking on each of the .exes in there, just to check what the heck each of them do). Later when I was 10-12 I've started to read some old books about Visual Basic 6.0 and creating some programs for fun, and that's when I also started with GNU+Linux.
<p>Euro/Euroblitz is my nickname and my internet name, so I prefer to leave things like this. I'm 25 now, born and living in Brazil, almost fluent in english and self learnt, and I have a boyfriend, we're together since mid 2019 and it's the best thing that happened to me on this decade. I'm a calm guy, I get better sinergy with computers and electronics than people sometimes, but this doesn't prevents me from having a good time and conversation with people. I'm also a grade 1 autistic person, this means I'm not that good at talking, taking facial expressions, sometimes I get a little clunky at work when I'm on that days to talk with my coworkers. I'm too concentrated in odd things, sometimes I dropped my classes just for watching some coding videos and trying to replicate them in java, that's just not too good sometimes. But I try to get things done as far as I can.
<h3>What I currently do</h3>
<p> I have a degree as a technician and in computer science (that I'm finishing in some months), I'm more of a software guy because I get stressed too often when I have to screw some motherboard and I keep loosing the damn screws. I'm working for the government now, fixing computers at public schools, solving software problems and fixing out small Windows Server machine here when it breaks. It's focused towards daycares and schools mostly, I like it. 
<p>I used to work in the logistics area, taking care of soy/bean/rice trucks that we export to other countries. I did work as a isp technician, a gas stop organizing stuff, also 2 years on our city's port taking care of paperwork.
<h3>Brief period of being vegan</h3>
<p>I was trying a vegetarian diet for a while, but since I had to complement every meal with some medication and I didn't have that much passion to cook along with time and patience, I just gave up for now. I like everything that a normal person likes, pizza, ice cream, that stuff. My top tier food is mom's lasagna. I like almost everything you put in front of me, I simply eat it. There's just eggplant that I absolutely hate and can't deal even with its smell, so keep it far away from me please.
