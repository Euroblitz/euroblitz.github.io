         <h3>A thing or two about me and some apologies</h3>
         <p>Please read carefuly, this came entirely from me.
         <p>I can be an “old fashioned thinker” at times, unfortunately I was taught to behave that way. My parents are still from that old generation who would threaten me with death if I came out as gay when I was a teenager (especially my father, and that's what happened to me a long time ago). It was only recently (about 5 years) that I finally started dating a guy and came out as an asexual man.
         <p>Things started to make a little sense in my head about sexuality and how things worked, how I wasn't mentally ill because I wasn't sexually attracted to boys or girls or anything. And being in the furry community surrounded by wonderful people, each one of them helped me decipher what was going on in my head and made this transition from a person who hid my sexuality, to being who I truly was.
         <p>I owe a lot to these people, and I feel that my attitudes in recent times have distanced me a lot from them, completely changing the way they saw me, being contrary to the image I wanted to portray online.
         <p>I was never actually transphobic, racist, sexist or misogynistic in any way, but my actions were. Despite being politically incorrect, for me they were never more than bad jokes, unfortunately I was raised like that. On the outside, I just wanted to cause chaos online and upset as many people involved in the matter as possible, because they spread photos of me and important conversations I had with people who I thought were my friends, but in the end they got carried away by a "exposed on twitter" and that took on gigantic proportions.
         <p>What worries me now is people seeing me as transphobic and racist, things that I never was, at most I was always ignorant with the people on Twitter and because the shit was already done and no one would care anymore, things are different with my trans and crossdresser friends since they've known me forever and I've always made jokes but on Twitter things were very different. I'm not going to lie that I posted some transphobic things but it was out of my pure ignorance, it was after I received a threat in my Twitter DMs to take it out on everyone, it was never with the intention of being transphobic or discriminatory, just misdirected anger.
         <p>The last straw was my last comment asking "why do trans people on Twitter always use the term "cis" to try to diminish non-trans people?" Unfortunately I used the term "normal" to refer to people who are not trans, thinking that was completely normal. Heck, I always heard my parents and a few IRL friends talking like trans people were abominations or something. Even though I have always turned my nose up at this type of discrimination against LGBT+ people, I have always kept it to myself for fear that, if I ended up defending any type of LGBT+ manifestation, this would reach my parents and the situation would become difficult. I prioritized living under a roof over defending LGBT+ causes and having to deal with my parents.
         <p>I care about the people I upset and I just wanted to apologize in person, it was never the image I wanted to convey to anyone. I am deeply sorry and I sincerely apologize for being an asshole, unfortunately I can't apologize personally to everyone I hurt because most of them don't want to talk to me, have sent me death threats or simply blocked me without me having a chance, but I hope this reaches someone and at least shows my regret.
