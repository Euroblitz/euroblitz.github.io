         <h3>Turok 2: Seeds of Evil (PC/Steam/GOG) Arachnophobia mod</h3>
         <p>We had an simple idea to replace all spider models from Turok 2 by small and large dinossaurs depending on the spider sizes, since there wasn't any mod like this for Turok. The mod can be pretty effective depending of how one's phobia works (specially in Blind Lair maps).
         <p>Since it's just a simple model swap made in Blender made by <a href="https://twitter.com/doommarine23">DoomMarine23</a>, expect some weird behavior like imprecise hitbox and janky animations from the model, but overall it was perfectly playable, specially for my boyfriend that has arachnophobia.

         <p>We're also working in a complete map overhaul to remove all cobwebs and spider eggs from the base game, and planning to do the same with toe COOP mod from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIHkVtCW20b0OPgO9A4xcVA">BehemothProgrammer</a>, might be out soon or not.
