         <h3>Santander app was driving me crazy, so I gave up on it and moved my savings to another less intrusive bank</h3>
         <p>No, really. I've always had issues with the Santander banking app because I refuse to run any bloated or spooky Android Stock firmware (Xiaomi, Samsung, Motorola) and I've always used Replicant or LineageOS ROMs on my phones, no exception. There was one time I refused to get a newer phone because I couldn't unlock its bootloader neither was any custom ROM support for it (not even root capability at the time) so I just stick with my older one, a little beaten up and swollen battery that made me charge it almost two times per day.
         <p>Basically, Santander App for Android that's my new banking app just refuses to open on anything I try. Android 7/8/9/10/11, stock or LineageOS, rooted or not. There was one week that it randomly started working on LineageOS and it was a 2021 security patch (I was using it on 2023). I was already used to do my transactions by the banking website on my computer, since even if you can't use the app logged in for more than 5 seconds until it force closes, QR scanning and authenticator for the banking website still works (there's a button for it on the login screen of the Santander app).
         <p>I've never had so many issues like this, and I always used other banking apps on the same rooted/custom firmware phone, they just don't care if your bootloader is unlocked or not since there's no actual way to hak infinite money or something. For what I noticed, Santander basically doesn't:
         <ul>
         <li>Allow the user to run/use their app with a rooted phone
         <li>Allow the user to run/use their app with a unlocked bootloader
         <li>Allow the user to run/use their app with a phone running  a custom ROM
         <li>Allow the user to run/use their app without Google Play Services*
            <p>
            </ul>
                  <ul><ul><li><small>Aparently even if you use someting like microG services like I do to spoof Google SafetyNet (sometimes it works and sometimes doesn't, it's basically hit or miss rolling a 50/50 chance dice) or even using Google Apps itself, the App won't run due to Google's SafetyNet checks not passing (older Android version, custom ROM, unlocked bootloader, root).</small>
                  <p>
               <li><small>I recently gave this phone to my dad and he's using it with LineageOS and Google Play Services, and there's a lot of random stuff he can't use like a specific store app to check bills (that for some reason needs the SafetyNet pass check) and energy bills app.</small></ul></ul>
<p><ul><li>Don't give any support regarding the app crash, and if you don't have a burner phone or a newer phone like they recommend you're basically stuck to ATMs to see the balance and take money out.</li></></ul></li>
            <p>
            <ul>
               <li>Allow the user do mostly any services without using the app</small>
                   <p><ul><li><small>If you need an allowance, change per month value, renegotiate, activate a new credit card, use PIX (Brazil's digital coin money similar to Cash App) you need to use the Santander App. Recently I tried contacting the Bank Manager personally, and I wasn't successfull on getting an allowance because there's a notification inside the app and you need to confirm it, doesn't work on the banking on computer, and I couldn't use the app because it just crashes.</p></ul></li></small>
            </ul>
            <p>I basically said a big <i>"f**k you"</i> to Santander and I moved my savings and my future payments to Nubank (that's a digital banking app that just works and aparently still there's no restrictions, despite being a proprietary app). I don't see myself buying a new phone in the near future, and if I could I wish that I didn't need one for anything.
