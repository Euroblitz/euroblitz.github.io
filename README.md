         <p>Hello! This is my personal webpage where I host my (mostly dead) projects and other cool stuff about me. I will keep these pages as minimal and resource-friendly as possible, without anything else that web doesn't needs to work. Here you can find out who I am or what I do as well, and some config files for Linux/Windows ricing, scripts, and other things I like to code or do. I also make some music under the <a href="https://virtualpleasure.bandcamp.com/music">VIRTUAL PLEASURE</a> artistic name and I'm trying to upload them here from time to time.
         <p>As I don't use (<a href="/contact.html">almost</a>) any social network pages to share content I tought it was a good idea to create this page and share everything I would like if I had one, with no restrictions or censorship. Even if I don't update it too often, I like how it looks. If you want to know more stuff about me and my character check under <a href="/bio.html">bio</a> and <a href="fursona">fursona</a>, I have a pretty cool art gallery of my sona there if you want to sneak into it. And I usually make some blog posts and a few Linux tutorials on how to fix/run some weird stuff if you're into that kind of stuff.
      <h3>A quick notice about the CSS/JavaScript styling</h3>
         I had to use some JavaScript code to fix some dark/light mode styling on this webpage, but this could be easily ignored or disabled since it's more of an novelty than something trivial to make the website load. I assume it would just reset to the default dark theme depending of the browser's preference. Note that older web browsers don't has this feature enabled or existant at all. There's zero non-free code or anything that would spy or fingerprint you!
