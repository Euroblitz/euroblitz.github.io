	<h3>welcome to my website (and this repo)</h3>
	<p>this website is focused in text mode and you can use the browser links on linux or anything, and probably if you use [curl] or [wget] it will also work, but I'm not sure. i will keep these pages as minimal and resource-friendly as possible
	<p>here you can find some info about me, who I am or what I do, as well some config files for linux/windows desktop ricing, scripts, and things I like to code using simple shell script, batch and ocasinally c/c++.
	<p>this website is compatible with internet explorer 1, potatoes, phones and probably anything with a screen should open it. the way the web is supposed to be.
