         <h3>Dotfiles and fluff</h3>
<p>Use whatever you like or how you like it, modify and take parts from the config files, I personally don't care (that's how we start ricing anyways). And I'm not that well organized, so some of my dotfiles may seem a bit weird on the config files but when I have some time I'll definitely make the code pretty and easier to read. And these dotfiles are kinda old too, I'm not that much into customization anymore since I become a vanilla KDE Plasma user whe I started to use Gentoo (3 years now lol).

<h3>Bright orange i3wm config</h3>

<p>I've used i3-gaps, that's my go-to tiling wm, along with polybar and picom for transparency, but this time I just used a lighter color from my wallpaper because picom was turned off. Here's the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/pitxeb/i3gaps_embrace_the_void_even_if_its_bright_enough/">unixporn reddit link</a>. For the dotfiles, <a href="https://github.com/Euroblitz/yellow-dotfiles">check here</a>. I also have used an ascii art generator for the void linux supremacy text, <a href="https://patorjk.com/software/taag/">here you go</a>.

<h3>Dark clouds i3wm</h3>
<img src="https://i.redd.it/bupyfww4xhq61.jpg"></img>
<p>For this one, i3-gaps as well, cmus, nano, pfetch, nothing really special. That was one of the first rices I did. You can follow the reddit post link <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/mho86a/i3gaps_cloudy_day/">right here</a>

<h3>Old but gold XFCE4/Debian</h3>
<img src="https://i.redd.it/lxveimdg3pc71.png"></img>
<p>I loved that one, it's not technically an rice but i've put some effort to make it work fine. As I don't have the dotfiles for it, you can check the xfwm4 theme and the r/unixporn thread here. There are instructions on how to install and get it working on <a href="https://www.xfce-look.org/p/1371886/">IndigoMagic for XFCE</a> and my <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/op70b7/xfce4_old_but_gold/">Reddit link here</a>.
<h3>Furry trash i3wm</h3>
<img src="https://i.redd.it/7nbvbzt9ouv61.png"></img>
<p>Nothing too fancy, just some pretty colors and a nice wallpaper. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/n07t5v/i3gaps_ruwunixporn/">r/unixporn link</a>.
