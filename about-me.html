------------------------------ About me ---------------------------------

I'm Euro (as Eurobeat and Blitzcrank). I'm a 21yo brazilian guy that
likes a lot technology, Linux, and computer thingies. I'm not an impor-
tant person or anything, I just exist here like everyone else. I'm also
a furry, have a nice purple bear-demon character, that's my fursona.

I don't have any favorite song, music, movie, or game. Yes, I have some 
'top songs playlist' that I listen more frequently than others, for an
example, but it's really difficult to compare these things with others, 
for example, I'll take two games I play a lot:

I'm a League of Legends player, since around 2013. I like some of its 
characters, play with only 1 or 2 maximum, but it doesn't means that I 
love the game. I have a emotional connection with a robot called as
Blitzcrank, but I hate the game (and also love it); Also, I play Team 
Fortress 2 since 2019. It's also a really nice game, I've had the most 
fun times of my youth playing this with a friend, but there's something 
different beetween these two, even discarding the playtime I have on 
each of them (that are ridiculously different).

I like them in different ways and aspects, and I think I'm not the only
person in the world that think like this, I can't compare art.
