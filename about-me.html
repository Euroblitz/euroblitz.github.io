		<p>well, what can i say? i'm a linux enthustiast of course. i like to shove down every part of my pc and operating system since i was 7-8 (my 'hobby' when i was at that age was looking through windows/system32 folders and clicking on each of the .exes in there, just to check what the heck each of them do). later when i was 10-12 i've started to read some old books about visual basic 6.0 and creating some programs for fun.
		<p>i'm euro (matheus if you wanna know my real name for some reason), euro is my nickname and my internet name, so i prefer like this, heh. i'm 21 now, born and living in brazil, almost fluent in english and self learn. i'm a calm guy, i get better sinergy with computers and electronics than people sometimes, but this doesn't prevents me from having a good time and conversation with people.
		<p>i'm also an autistic person, this means i'm not that good at talking, taking facial expressions, sometimes i get a little clunky at work when i'm on that days to talk with my coworkers. i'm too concentrated in odd things, sometimes i dropped my classes just for watching some coding videos and trying to replicate them in java, that's just not too good sometimes. but i try to get things done as far as i can.
		<h3>what i do</h3>
		<p>i have a degree as a technician and in computer science (that i'm finishing in some months), i'm more of a software guy i get stressed too often when i have to screw some motherboard and i keep loosing the damn screws. i'm a furry (not so proud of it, but if you wanna check <a href="https://www.furaffinity.net/user/eurob/">here's my furaffinity profile.</a> i work in the logistics area, i weigh soy/bean/rice trucks that we export to other countries. i did work as a isp technician, a gas stop organizing stuff, also 2 years on our city's port taking care of paperwork.
		<h3>food</h3>
		<p>yeah, food. i'm trying an vegetarian diet for a while, but gonna check it in some time if do i need to complement it with something. i like everything that a normal person likes, pizza, ice cream, that stuff. my top tier food is mom's lasagna. i like almost everything you put in front of me, i simply eat it. there's just eggplant that i absolutel hate and can't deal even with its smell, so keep it far away from me please.
